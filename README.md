# ITSRestart
Simple Restart Application

This program adds an MFC Application that acts as a restart button to the desktop in the lower right-hand corner. 
In its current iteration, shutdowns are forced after a user confirmation within the dialogue box.


This program was deployed to ~10,000 Seneca College ITS Student Workstations.
